# Instance Segmentation

Instance segmentation in event-based videos (Research project).

Required background knowledge:
- TODO: Add links ...

## Setting up Miniconda
For this project we are currently using: Python 3.9 and Miniconda3  
Make a Virtual environment with Miniconda3 by following this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gtHso20YMQ&ab_channel=CharlBotha).
```
conda create --name instance_segmentation python=3.9  
conda info --envs  
conda activate instance_segmentation  
```

## Badges
TODO: add badges or remove section...

[comment]: <> (On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.)

## Visuals
TODO: add visual...

[comment]: <> (Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video &#40;you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos&#41;. Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.)

## Usage
TODO: add explanation of output...

[comment]: <> (Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.)

[comment]: <> (## Support)

[comment]: <> (Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.)

## Contributing
TODO: add how to contribute...

[comment]: <> (State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.)

[comment]: <> (For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.)

[comment]: <> (You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.)
